# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course project
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## Steps taken
1. Download the dataset into a folder on local drive.
2. Put run_analysis.R in this folder with the dataset, then set working directory with  setwd() function.
3. Run *source("run_analysis.R")*, then it will generate a file *tiny_data.txt* in the working directory.

##Dependencies
With *run_analysis.R*, every dependency will be automatically installed.
